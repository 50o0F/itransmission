#summary How to build Transmission command line apps and iTransmission from source code

= Building dependencies =

  # Get build.sh from source repository, e.g. https://raw.github.com/ccp0101/iTransmission/master/make_depend/build.sh
  # Edit $ARCH in build.sh to either i386 for simulator or armv7 for device
  # Edit package versions in build.sh
  # Execute build.sh will automatically fetch required source code and patch them
  # If successfully built, output files will be in $PWD/out, including transmission-daemon and libtransmission.a

= Building iTransmission =

If you built the dependencies yourself, move output directory (e.g.: $PWD/out) to project root and rename it to "libraries"

If you use prebuilt binaries, this has been taken care of. 

Then build IPAs in Xcode.
