#summary Magnet links: what they are, and how to use them.

==What are "magnet links"?==
Simply put, magnet links are like HTTP web addresses, but rather than pointing to a website, they point to a torrent file, and an associated torrent tracker.

==Why use a magnet link?==
Magnet links have a distinct advantage over downloading a .torrent file: since it's a link, the user doesn't have to download anything. Just enter the magnet link, and the torrent program does the rest. Especially in iTransmission, this avoids the cumbersome task of having to search for .torrent files and add them manually.

==How do I us magnet links with iTransmission?==
On computers, magnet links can be associated with the relevant torrent application; however, on iOS, this cannot be (currently) done, to my knowledge. However, magnet links are still relatively easy to use, simply by copying-and-pasting, like thus:

 # If the torrent website you're visiting has a magnet link, press and hold the link until Mobile Safari prompts you to either OPEN or COPY the link. Choose COPY:

 # Open (or switch to) iTransmission, and click on the + symbol in the lower left-hand corner:

 # Click the "magnet" button:

 # Click the "OK" button.
 # The magnet link will become a torrent. Torrents are added in a paused state, so click "RESUME" in the left-hand corner of the torrent.
